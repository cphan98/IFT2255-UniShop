This software coded in Java is a command-line based e-commerce platform destined to students wanting to buy school materials at a very competitive price and an efficient way to find the necessary products through a user-friendly interface. 
In that software, they can:

* Find diverse products and utilities for their studies
* Order these products and receive them at home
* Give and read evaluations and comments about each product
* Discover articles recommended by other users
* Find a product retailer that corresponds to their preferences

## Getting Started
To begin using UniShop through command line, you have all the prerequisite to get it going.

### Installation
* Make sure to have JDK-20 installed on your machine before usage. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk20-archive-downloads.html)
* Ensure to have the latest stable release of Maven if you haven't already from [Maven's website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

### Usage
Head through the UniShop class that contains the main method. When you launch UniShop for the first time, its database is going to be initialized with premade orders, products and users, and every time you quit it, the database will be saved into a serialized file at the root of the project.

The base data consists of:
* 10 buyers
* 5 sellers
* 20 products (4 for each product category)
* 12 pre-made order, with each one having a different status

Here are the credentials of one buyer and one seller:

| Type of role        | Username           | Password  |
| --------------------|:------------------:| ---------:|
| Buyer               | cphan98            |   1234    |
| Seller              | Deraina            |   1234    |

Run the program through that class. It will kickstart the UniShop platform and you're ready to go! Enjoy!
