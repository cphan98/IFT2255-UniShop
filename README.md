This software coded in Java is a command-line based e-commerce platform destined to students wanting to buy school materials at a very competitive price and an efficient way to find the necessary products through a user-friendly interface. 
In that software, they can:

* Find diverse products and utilities for their studies
* Order these products and receive them at home
* Give and read evaluations and comments about each product
* Discover articles recommended by other users
* Find a product retailer that corresponds to their preferences

## Getting Started
To begin using UniShop through command line, you have all the prerequisite to get it going.

### Installation
* Make sure to have JDK-20 installed on your machine before usage. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk20-archive-downloads.html)
* Ensure to have the latest stable release of maven if you haven't already from [Maven's website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

### Usage
Head through the UniShop class that contains the main method and to initialize the sample data for testing purposes, which consists of at least one buyer and one seller, for example:

| Type of role        | Username           | Password  |
| --------------------|:------------------:| ---------:|
| Buyer               | cphan98            |   1234    |
| Seller              | Deraina            |   1234    |

Run the program through that class. It will kickstart the UniShop platform and you're ready to go! Enjoy!
